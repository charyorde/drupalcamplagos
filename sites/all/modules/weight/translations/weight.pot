msgid "<h3>Description:</h3><p>The weight module adds a weight option to enabled node types. It uses the \"sticky\" field in the database to store weights as well as sticky information (so that feature is not lost). Nodes will be sorted first by stickiness, then by weight (lightest to heaviest), then by creation date.</p>\r\n        <h4>Setup:</h4><p>To enable weight sorting on existing nodes, visit the <a href=\"@setup\">weight db setup page</a> and select which node types to allow weighting. When you click \"Save configuration,\" the module will convert old sticky values to new weight-encoded values for proper sorting. If you de-select a type, weights on all nodes of that type will be converted back to standard sticky values.</p>\r\n        <h4>Permissions:</h4><p>Users with \"administer nodes\" permission will always be able to adjust weight for enabled node types. However, enabling \"assign node weight\" will allow non-node-admin users to adjust weight on their own nodes. Find these settings <a href=\"@access\">here</a>.</p>\r\n        <h4>Bulk weight management</h4><p>You may easily manage the weight of multiple nodes simultaneously by using the <a href=\"@node_admin\"> node admin page</a>.</p>"
